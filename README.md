# CSE474_Neural_Network_Classification_on_MNIST_Data
Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and assessed its performance in classifying MNIST data of handwritten digits. Also used the same network to analyze a more challenging Google's AI Quick Draw hand-drawn images dataset and compared the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library.
